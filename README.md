Contains Invisible Chunks world download and explanation
## Invisible Chunks
Basically when a minecraft chunk is marked as not populated, it will not be sent to the client, making it invisble. Usually you won't see this, because these chunks would be very far away, but a bug that has existed ever since population existed allows you to stand right next to these invisible chunks. For further information I recommend watching Myren Eario's video: https://youtu.be/KU3lN1IUhuE
## How to create Invisible Chunks
First, download the world in the main branch and put it into your saves folder. Now, load this instance with 1.12.2, and set your render distance to something low (I used 4). Now open the world. If the world loaded correctly you should be next to a budded rail line. Update these rails by placing a block next to them. You can now fly towards the end of the rail line, and you'll see 3 invisible chunks. I recommend turning VBOs off, because that will make many more chunks invisble because of the extra culling. The real invisible chunks have now block outlines if  you look into them.
